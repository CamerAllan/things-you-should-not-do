# [More Things You Should Not Do](https://tysnd.ccallan.dev/)

This project is based on the XKCD comic [Things You Should Not Do](https://xkcd.com/2669/).
Every day, more things are added to the list of Things You Should Not Do, generated by _state of the art Artificial Intelligence_.

It's part an exercise in reproducing the aesthetic of XKCD comics, part test of recent LLM's sense of humour.

## Hosting

[More Things You Should Not Do](https://tysnd.ccallan.dev/) is hosted for free on Netlify, and it rebuilt on pushing to this repository.
A cron job runs the `./generator/run.sh` script every day at midnight.

It's simple, stupid and ugly but it works real good!

## Cost

About a penny a day.
