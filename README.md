# Things You Should Not Do++

This project is based on the XKCD comic [Things You Should Not Do](https://xkcd.com/2669/).
Every day, a *new* list of Things You Should Not Do will be generated by *state of the art* Artificial Intelligence.

Hacked together in a couple of evenings so don't look too close.
